## Signum Classic Wallet moved to another repository!

In this folder it will be copied the files of the folder `src/` from the repository (signum-classic-wallet)[https://github.com/signum-network/signum-classic-wallet/].

The process is automated during a release creation. For more info check the `release.yml` workflow.
