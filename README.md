# Installation

## Prerequisites (All Platforms)

**NOTE: `burst.sh` is now deprecated and is not included on this release.**

### Java 8 (Recommended) or higher

You need Java 8 (recommended) or higher installed. To check your java version, run `java -version`. You should get an output similar to the following:

```text
java version "1.8.0_181"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)
```

The important part is that the Java version starts with `1.8` (Java 8)

If you do not have Java installed, download it from [Oracle's Website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

### MariaDB (Optional)

[Download and install MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/mariadb-tx)

The MariaDb installation will ask to setup a password for the root user. 
Add this password to the `brs.properties` file you will create when installing BRS:

```properties
DB.Url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/brs_master
DB.Username=root
DB.Password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

## Installation

You can manually install using the following steps, or by using the pre-packaged options below.

### Manually installing - All Platforms

Grab the latest release (Or, if you prefer, compile yourself using the instructions below)

In the conf directory, copy `brs-default.properties` into a new file named `brs.properties` and modify this file to suit your needs (See "Configuration" section below)

To run BRS, double click on `burst.exe` (if on Windows) or run `java -jar burst.jar`.
On most systems this will show you a monitoring window and will create a tray icon to show that BRS is running. To disable this, instead run `java -jar burst.jar --headless`.

### Installation Packages

#### Windows

[QBundle](https://github.com/burst-apps-team/qbundle) is a tool which will automatically download any required files and tools and manage BRS for you. This is recommended for users who do not want to learn how to setup BRS.

## Configuration

### Running on mainnet (unless you are developing or running on testnet, you will probably want this)

There is no need to change any configuration. Optionally, if you want to used mariadb (see above), you will need to add the following to your `conf/brs.properties`:

```properties
DB.Url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/brs_master
DB.Username=brs_user
DB.Password=yourpassword
```

Also look through the existing properties if there is anything you want to change.

### Testnet

Please see the [Wiki article](https://burstwiki.org/en/testnet/) for details on how to setup a testnet node.

### Private Chains

In order to run a private chain, you need the following properties:

```properties
DEV.DB.Url=(Your Database URL)
DEV.DB.Username=(Your Database Username)
DEV.DB.Password=(Your Database Password2)
API.Listen = 0.0.0.0
API.allowed = *
DEV.TestNet = yes
DEV.Offline = yes
DEV.digitalGoodsStore.startBlock = 0
DEV.automatedTransactions.startBlock = 0
DEV.atFixBlock2.startBlock = 0
DEV.atFixBlock3.startBlock = 0
DEV.atFixBlock4.startBlock = 0
DEV.prePoc2.startBlock = 0
DEV.poc2.startBlock = 0
DEV.rewardRecipient.startBlock = 0
```

Optionally, if you want to be able to forge blocks faster, you can add the following properties:

```properties
DEV.mockMining = true
DEV.mockMining.deadline = 10
```

This will cause a block to be forged every 10 seconds. Note that P2P is disabled when running a private chain and is incompatible with mock mining.
