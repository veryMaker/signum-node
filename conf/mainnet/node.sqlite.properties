## Sqlite Journaling Mode
## https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode
## Possible Values are: DELETE,TRUNCATE,PERSIST,WAL (default, recommended)
## WAL may occupy up to twice more disc space than others while running the node, but allows read concurrency and usually better performance (see more here: https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html)
## It's highly recommended to use WAL mode during syncing, to dramatically reduce I/O operations and though faster sync times.
## Info: MEMORY journal mode is not supported
# DB.SqliteJournalMode = WAL

## Sqlite synchronous
## https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous
## Lowering this parameter can increase performance, but decrease reliability.
## FULL (default) is the safest, but NORMAL should be also fine for running a local node.
## Setting this to OFF could lead to database corruption on opertaing system crash or power loss!
# DB.SqliteSynchronous = NORMAL

## Sqlite cache_size
## https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size
## Positive value sets the number of cache pages to use (default page size is 4096 bytes).
## Negative value sets the number of cache pages, so it would use approximately N * 1024 bytes of memory. 
## Increasing this the number of cache pages can increase performance at the cost of memory usage.
# DB.SqliteCacheSize = -2000
